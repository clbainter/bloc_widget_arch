# Bloc Widget Architecture
An architecture that introduces a powerful and organized approach to 
building flutter applications. This package provides an assortment 
of abstract classes and utilities that seamlessly integrate with the 
BLoC pattern, enabling you to create clear and maintainable code.

## Features

- **BlocWidget:** An abstract class at the core of the Bloc Widget Architecture. It serves as a blueprint for structuring widgets that effectively interact with BLoCs. Extend this class to create widgets that respond to BLoC events and efficiently update the UI based on state changes.

- **StatefulBlocWidget:** A class designed for crafting stateful widgets that interact with BLoCs. By inheriting from this class, you can effortlessly pair your BLoC with a widget while keeping your codebase modular and clean.

- **StatelessBlocWidget:** Designed for the creation of stateless widgets that work harmoniously with BLoCs. Subclassing this abstract class simplifies the process of integrating BLoCs into widgets and ensures that your UI remains responsive and up-to-date.
